# NexusHorizon EdTech Platform

## Overview

This is a full-stack project platform built with modern web technologies. The application provides course management functionality for both students and professors, featuring user authentication, course enrollment, and administrative capabilities.

## Architecture

### Backend (Server)

The backend is built using Node.js with TypeScript and follows a layered architecture pattern. The server directory contains all backend-related code organized into distinct modules for maintainability and scalability.

**Core Technologies:**

- Node.js with TypeScript for type safety and modern JavaScript features
- Express.js as the web application framework
- Apollo Server for GraphQL API implementation
- PostgreSQL as the primary database
- Prisma ORM for database operations and schema management

**Folder Structure:**

The server follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
server/
├── src/
│   ├── common/           # Shared utilities and configuration
│   ├── daos/            # Data Access Objects for database operations
│   ├── services/        # Business logic layer
│   ├── graphql/         # GraphQL schema and resolvers
│   └── main.ts          # Application entry point
├── prisma/              # Database schema and migrations
└── api/                 # API endpoints and GraphQL setup
```

**Database Layer:**
PostgreSQL was chosen as the database for its reliability and ACID compliance, which is crucial for educational data integrity. Prisma serves as the ORM providing type-safe database queries and automatic migration management. The schema includes core entities like Users, Courses, and Enrollments with proper relationships.

**API Layer:**
GraphQL was implemented using Apollo Server to provide a flexible and efficient API. This allows the frontend to request exactly the data it needs, reducing over-fetching and improving performance. The GraphQL schema is organized by domain with separate resolvers for authentication, courses, users, and enrollments.

**Business Logic:**
Services handle the core business logic, including authentication, course management, and enrollment processing. The DAO pattern is used for database operations, providing a clean abstraction layer between business logic and data persistence.

### Frontend (Client)

The frontend is built with Next.js 15 using the App Router pattern and TypeScript throughout. The application follows React best practices with a component-based architecture and centralized state management.

**Core Technologies:**

- Next.js 15 with App Router for server-side rendering and routing
- React 18 with TypeScript for component development
- Apollo Client for GraphQL data fetching and state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
- React Context API for authentication and course state management

**Folder Structure:**

The client follows Next.js conventions with additional organization for scalability:

```
client/
├── src/
│   ├── app/             # Next.js App Router pages
│   ├── components/      # Reusable UI components
│   ├── context/         # React Context providers
│   ├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
│   ├── lib/             # GraphQL queries and utilities
│   ├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
│   └── utils/           # Utility functions
└── public/              # Static assets
```

**State Management:**
The application uses a hybrid approach to state management. Apollo Client manages server state and GraphQL operations, while React Context handles authentication state and course management. This separation allows for optimal caching and real-time updates.

**Component Architecture:**
Components are organized by feature and reusability. UI components are kept generic and reusable, while page-specific components handle business logic. The RoleGuard component provides role-based access control throughout the application.

**Authentication:**
JWT-based authentication is implemented with secure token storage and automatic refresh. The authentication context provides user state management across the entire application.

## Key Features

**User Management:**
The platform supports role-based access with distinct interfaces for students and professors. Authentication is handled securely with proper session management.

**Course Management:**
Professors can create, edit, and manage courses with different difficulty levels. The system tracks enrollment counts and student progress.

**Enrollment System:**
Students can browse available courses and enroll in those that match their learning goals. The system prevents duplicate enrollments and manages capacity.

**Dashboard Views:**
Role-specific dashboards provide relevant information and actions. Professors see course management tools while students see their enrolled courses and progress.

## Development Setup

The database schema is managed through Prisma migrations, ensuring consistent database state across different environments. Seed data is provided for initial setup and testing.

## Security Considerations

The application implements proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Role-based access control ensures users can only access appropriate functionality. Database queries are protected against common vulnerabilities through Prisma's type-safe query builder.

## Performance Optimizations

GraphQL reduces data over-fetching while Apollo Client provides intelligent caching. The Next.js App Router enables optimal loading and rendering strategies. Component architecture supports code splitting and lazy loading where beneficial.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for an educational platform that can scale with growing user bases and feature requirements while maintaining code quality and developer productivity.
