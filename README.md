# Devi's EdTech Learning Platform

A modern full-stack learning platform built with GraphQL API, role-based access control, and course management system.

## ðŸš€ Quick Local Setup

For running the complete system locally with local database:

### Automated Setup (Windows)

1. **Run the database setup script:**
   ```powershell
   .\setup-database.ps1
   ```

2. **Start both servers:**
   ```powershell
   .\start-local.ps1
   ```
   Or use the batch file:
   ```cmd
   start-local.bat
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend GraphQL: http://localhost:4000/graphql

### Manual Setup

See [LOCAL_SETUP.md](./LOCAL_SETUP.md) for detailed manual setup instructions.
